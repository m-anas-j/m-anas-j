- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m @m-anas-j and I welcome you to my repo.
- I have just started revamping my github, so it's still a work in progress.
- My interests include Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am currently working on multiple projects spanning over question-answering, image-captioning, and multimodal HCI.
- At present, my repo consists of mostly my undergraduate projects, but I plan to include my current projects soon.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Drop me a line @m.anas.j on Instagram and I'll get back to you asap.
